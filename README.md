##Post Me!

About The Project

Buyers and sellers will be able to connect on the "Post Me" website. Sellers can list their items and buyers can browse through the currently available items and then contact the seller if they wish to buy something. 

Some of these sample items are actual items that I have recently sold within the last two weeks on either Craigslist or EBay.

Feel free to visit my Ebay Store! "https://www.ebay.com/usr/streetfinder2012"

Getting Started: 

Buyers: Look through postings and click the email link to buy something new!

Sellers: List your item and fill out the fields. Make sure to leave an accurate phone or email address so your item can get sold!

No authentication is required and sellers can be almost anonymous by using spoofed phone numbers and any email address. IP's and other identifying data is not collected.


Next Steps: TBD
